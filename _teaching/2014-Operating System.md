Its main content is to explain the construction principle of the operating system, the functions that each module should complete, and the commonly used methods for implementing these functions. Completing this course can enable students in this major to have a clearer understanding of how user assignments are inputted into the computer, and how the computer stores, manages, and runs (processes) these assignments internally until the results are output. This involves the issues of how to manage processors, memory, I/O devices, and file systems.
Due to the different goals pursued by different operating systems and the different implementation methods used to achieve their target functions, it is difficult to analyze their source code, and we can only qualitatively analyze their commonalities and principles. This is one of the significant differences between studying this course and studying other courses in the computer industry.
